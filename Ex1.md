# Ex.Name:Write a C++ Program to read two fraction value from the keyboard and display the value on the monitor

## Aim:
To write a C++ Program to read two fraction value from the keyboard and display the value on the monitor.

## Algorithm:
1. Start
2. Read numerator and denominator of first fraction
3. Read numerator and denominator of second fraction
4. Display both fractions in numerator/denominator form
5. Stop

## Program:
```
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()

{
    float a,b;
    cin>>a>>b;

   

   cout<<"First Value is:"<<a<<endl;
   cout<<"Second Value is:"<<b;

   return 0;

}
```
